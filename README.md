Check out the PDF under Reports for more details

Final models are under notebooks/final

Experiments with different data representations are under notebooks/feature_extraction

There's a different environment for the XGBoost and TCN models, due to the TCN model needing special packages to use my computer's GPU

To use the XGBoost notebook, go to the envs folder and create its environment with this command:
`conda env create -f py_37_environment.yml`

To use the TCN notebook, go to the envs folder and create its environment with this command:
`conda env create -f tf_environment.yml`
